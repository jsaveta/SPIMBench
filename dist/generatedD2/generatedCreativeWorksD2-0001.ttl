Players score points by striking a shuttlecock with their racquet so that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents half of the court. Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net." ;

The first round was held on 31 October 2010 and a second round, in which President Laurent Gbagbo faced opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, was held on 28 November 2010. Originally scheduled to be held in 2005, the vote was delayed several times due to the Ivorian Civil War and difficulties involved in the organization and preparation of the election." ;
